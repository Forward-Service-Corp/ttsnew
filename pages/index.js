                    Welcome to Transition To Success&reg; (TTS). This TTS Workbook and Guide is designed specifically
                    for
                    YOU. Together with your Transition To Success (TTS) Coach, you will map your journey to your dreams
                    and
                    work together to make those dreams come true. Just like taking a trip, know where you are going to
                    make
                    sure you get there. Go after what you want. Make your dreams become reality. Mapping Dreams is for
                    everyone, regardless of your age, race, religion, male or female, rich or poor. All of us have
                    dreams.

                <h2 className={"my-5 font-bold text-cyan-600"}>How do I make my dreams come true?</h2>
                <p>
                    Just ask anyone, &quot;What&apos;s your dream?&quot;. You will find there are as many dreams as
                    there
                    are people. Having dreams is the easy part. Making your dreams come true is the tough part and
                    requires so much more than just wishing. Making dreams come true requires hope, plans, the ability
                    to ask for
                    help, determination, and money. Making a real plan, designed by you, that will work for you, is the
                    path to your success.

                    Each step you take brings you one step closer to your dream. Each step is a reason to celebrate.
                    And,
                    when &quot;life happens&quot; and a step suddenly turns into a slip or a fall, YOU start again. Just
                    like a wrong turn on a map, the key is to reroute. DO NOT STOP. Do not turn around. Keep moving.
                    Everyone has missteps, even when moving in the right direction. What really matters is what you do
                    next.

                    From now on giving up is not an option. To be the best you, you must embrace the missteps, learn
                    from your mistakes, and re-route. Keep moving, and YOU will get to your destination.
