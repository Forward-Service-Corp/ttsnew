                    to
                    make sure you get there. Go after what you want. Make your dreams become reality. Mapping Dreams is

                <h2 className={"my-5 font-bold text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400"}>How do I make my dreams come true?</h2>
                <p className={"text-sm"}>
                    Just ask anyone, &quot;What&apos;s your dream?&quot;. You will find there are as many dreams as
                    there are people. Having dreams is the easy part. Making your dreams come true is the tough part and
                    requires so much more than just wishing. Making dreams come true requires hope, plans, the ability
                    to ask for help, determination, and money. Making a real plan, designed by you, that will work for
                    you, is the
                    path to your success.

                    Each step you take brings you one step closer to your dream. Each step is a reason to celebrate.
                    And, when &quot;life happens&quot; and a step suddenly turns into a slip or a fall, YOU start again.
                    Just
                    like a wrong turn on a map, the key is to reroute. DO NOT STOP. Do not turn around. Keep moving.
                    Everyone has missteps, even when moving in the right direction. What really matters is what you do
                    next.

                From now on giving up is not an option. To be the best you, you must embrace the missteps, learn
